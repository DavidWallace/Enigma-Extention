# Enigma Extention

A browser-based monero miner

## What is it?

This is a browser-based monero miner.

### How to Use

I will eventually have my own service set-up to distribute however for now, sign-up for [CoinHive](coinhive.com), update miner.js to your own public key like below:
```
var miner = new CoinHive.User('YOUR KEY', 'David');

```

Alternatively you can set it via the extention in chrome
